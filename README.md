# PlayStationDiscordRPC

PlayStation Discord RPC Client is a Qt TrayIcon application that fetches the current gaming status of the associated account and display the GameTitle and Image on your Discord Profile using the RPC Framework.

# Supported Games

The supported game repo is located at [PlayStationDiscordRPC_Games](https://github.com/flok/PlayStationDiscordRPC_Games). If you have a new game that you want to get supported head over there and create a pull request with the needed information. 

# Installation

You can find the latest version of PlayStationDiscordRPC under [Releases](https://github.com/flok/PlayStationDiscordRPC/releases). Just download the executable and place it in some folder. Start the app and you will be directed to the settings page. At the same time a tray icon will appear which gives you the options to stop the service or head to the settings page again.

# How it works

The app continously fetched the current status of your PSN profile from the PSN site and displays the game as a Discord status.

Below you see a game displayed as a status inside discord including the game icon picture and the status popup which is also availabe from double clicking the tray icon
